# Crow Search Algorithm for Portfolio Optimization

Welcome to the repository for our project on the **Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) for Portfolio Optimization**. This project was accepted for presentation at the prestigious **BAMS-ORSI (Business Analytics and Management Sciences)** annual conference, organized by the **Operational Research Society of India** and held at **IIT Bombay from 12th to 14th December 2024**.

## About the Project
The Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) is a metaheuristic optimization technique inspired by the intelligent and strategic behavior of crows in hiding and retrieving their food. In this project, we have leveraged CSA to optimize personalized investment portfolios under real-world constraints. The key highlights include:

- **Efficient Convergence**: CSA demonstrated the ability to converge to better solutions in fewer iterations compared to traditional optimization algorithms, making it computationally less expensive.
- **Real-Time Viability**: The reduced computational overhead of CSA ensures its applicability for real-time personalized portfolio optimization.
- **Comparative Analysis**: We compared CSA against other optimization algorithms to showcase its superiority in balancing risk and return while adhering to market constraints.

## Key Features
- Implementation of CSA for multi-asset portfolio optimization.
- Incorporation of real-world constraints such as:
  - Indivisible shares.
  - Tax regulations.
  - Limited product availability.
  - Liquidity concerns.
- Comparative performance analysis of CSA against other algorithms.

## Presentation Highlights
Our abstract and working project were showcased at the **BAMS-ORSI 2024** conference. During the demonstration, we highlighted:
- The **superiority of CSA** over traditional algorithms in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.
- How CSA makes portfolio optimization feasible and practical for real-time personalized use cases.

## Repository Contents
- **`crow.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the Crow Search Algorithm, portfolio optimization, and performance comparison.
- **Sample Data**: Sample datasets used for testing and validating the algorithm.
- **Results**: Visualizations and performance metrics comparing CSA with other algorithms.
